# WebScrapePRISMData
The PRISM Climate Group https://prism.oregonstate.edu/ gathers climate observations from a wide range of monitoring networks, applies sophisticated quality control measures, and develops spatial climate datasets to reveal short- and long-term climate patterns. In this project, I web scrape Kansas state county level weather data from the PRISM database. The code provided can be adjusted to obtain weather data at different subnational levels.
